                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>TechCon was founded in 2010 by a small group of passionate developers with a vision to create a collaborative space for the tech community. What started as a small, local meetup with 50 attendees has grown into a major international conference. Our commitment to accessibility and cutting-edge topics has made TechCon a must-attend event for professionals and students alike.</p>
